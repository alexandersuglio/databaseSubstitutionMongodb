**To use on your local machine**

Once you download the repo install dependencies with npm i

You'll need to open three seperate terminal prompts to enter the following commands;

npm start: to run react/launch dev server at port 8080,
mongod: to start mongo shell,
node server (Make sure you CD ./ into the SERVERSIDE folder for this): to launch server at port 3008,
